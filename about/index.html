                    <strong>Q: Is this a service that anyone can use?</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="about-faq-qa">
                    A: No, it's just a linktree clone that I made for myself to not have to deal with theses services
                    and to have full customization over it.

                    <strong>Q: Why the name "CARD.net"?</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="about-faq-qa">
                    A: Because I didn't wanted to have a really generic name like "Yet Another Linktree Clone" or something like that.

                    A: No, but feel free to copy the source code and make changes yourself. This project only uses HTML
                    and CSS, so you can easily customize it to your liking. To host it, you can use any hosting service.
                    If you want a free hosting service, take a look at Neocities and Github Pages.
